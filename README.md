# LeetCode Rust Solutions

This project contains solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Rust. The goal is to improve Rust programming skills and algorithmic thinking by solving a wide range of coding challenges.

## Project Structure

- Each exercise is implemented as a separate Rust module or file.
- Solutions are organized by problem number and title for easy reference.
- Test cases are included to verify correctness.

## List of Exercises

| Problem # | Title                        | Solution File         |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
